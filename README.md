# Image Restoration with DnCNN and NAFNet

This project explores deep learning models for restoring blurry low-resolution images. It compares a custom DnCNN-based super-resolution model with a transformer-style NAFNet architecture. Both were implemented and evaluated on the GOPRO and RealBlur-R datasets using Colab Pro (A100 GPU).

## 🚀 Highlights

* 🧠 **DnCNN-SR**: Residual CNN + PixelShuffle-based upsampling
* 🔬 **NAFNet**: Transformer-inspired architecture (implemented, not used for demo)
* 🎯 Metrics: PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS
* 🧪 Losses: MSE, perceptual (VGG), LPIPS
* ⚙️ Training: AMP, early stopping, ReduceLROnPlateau
* 📷 Output visualization and metric summary

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Model                | PSNR (↑)  | SSIM (↑)   | LPIPS (↓)  |
| -------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **DnCNN (demo)**     | **26.80** | **0.8020** | **0.2313** |
| NAFNet (implemented) | 26.73     | 0.8002     | 0.2377     |
| Joint model          | 24.63     | 0.8670     | N/A        |

> DnCNN showed the best perceptual and numerical performance. NAFNet was successfully implemented but not used in the final visualization due to training instability.

## 💡 Reflection: Why Simple Beats Complex

We originally tried this cascade:

> DnCNN → UNet → EDSR

While promising in theory, this chain:

* Suffered from compounding artifacts
* Was harder to converge
* Did not outperform DnCNN alone in PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS

📌 **Conclusion**: well-designed single models + quality upsampling outperform deep cascades in image restoration.
